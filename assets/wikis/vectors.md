## Whats AAV?
AAV stands for adeno-associated virus. It is small, and is a virus that cannot cause a disease, that is commonly used in gene therapy. AAV vectors are used to deliver genes to specific cells in the body. They are relatively safe and can be used to treat a wide range of diseases.

## AAV Vectors

The following is a list of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, with a brief description of each:

* **AAV2:** A common AAV vector that is used in gene therapy. It is relatively safe and can infect a wide range of cells.
* **AAV5:** A AAV vector that is similar to AAV2, but it is more efficient at delivering genes to the brain.
* **AAV1:** A AAV vector that is not as common as AAV2 or AAV5, but it is more stable and can last longer in the body.
* **AAV8:** A AAV vector that is specifically designed to target muscle cells.
* **AAV2/5:** A combination of AAV2 and AAV5 that is used to improve the efficiency of gene delivery.
* **AAV2/8:** A combination of AAV2 and AAV8 that is used to target muscle cells.
* **AAVrh10:** A AAV vector that is specifically designed to target retinal cells.
* **scAAV9:** A AAV vector that is specifically designed to target the spinal cord.
* **AAV9:** A AAV vector that is similar to scAAV9, but it is more efficient at delivering genes to the spinal cord.
* **SPK100:** A AAV vector that is specifically designed to target liver cells.
* **AAVrh74:** A AAV vector that is specifically designed to target glial cells.

Here is a table that summarizes the different AAV vectors:
