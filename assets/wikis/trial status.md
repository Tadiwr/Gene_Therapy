The variable status in the dataset refers to the current status of a clinical trial for a gene therapy drug. The possible values for the variable status are:

Active, no enrollment: The trial is currently recruiting participants.

Active, enrollment complete: The trial has completed recruiting participants, but the study is still ongoing.

Completed: The trial has been completed and the results have been published.

Suspended: The trial has been suspended for some reason, such as safety concerns or lack of funding.
The following is a list of clinical trial statuses, with a brief description of each:

* **Active, not recruiting:** A clinical trial that is still open, but is not currently recruiting new participants.
* **Recruiting:** A clinical trial that is actively recruiting new participants.
* **Completed:** A clinical trial that has finished enrolling participants and collecting data.
* **Terminated:** A clinical trial that has been stopped early, either because of safety concerns or because the study was not successful.
* **Unknown status:** A clinical trial whose status is not known, either because the trial has not yet started or because the trial sponsor has not updated the status information.

Here is a table that summarizes the different clinical trial statuses:
