# What are Phases

refers to the stage in which a clinical trial is under. A description of the phases is below; 

The following is a list of clinical trial phases, with a brief description of each:

* **Phase 1:** The first phase of clinical trials, in which a new drug or treatment is tested in a small group of people (usually 20-80) to assess its safety and determine the right dosage.
* **Phase 2:** The second phase of clinical trials, in which a new drug or treatment is tested in a larger group of people (usually 100-300) to further assess its safety and effectiveness.
* **Phase 3:** The third phase of clinical trials, in which a new drug or treatment is tested in a large group of people (usually 1,000-3,000) to confirm its safety and effectiveness, and to compare it to existing treatments.
* **Phase 4:** The fourth phase of clinical trials, in which a new drug or treatment is monitored after it has been approved for use to further assess its safety and effectiveness.

Phase 1/2 trials are a combination of Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. They are often used when a new drug or treatment is thought to have the potential to be very effective, but there is some concern about its safety. Phase 1/2 trials allow researchers to assess the safety of a new drug or treatment in a larger group of people, while also starting to gather data on its effectiveness.

Here is a table that summarizes the different clinical trial phases:

| Phase | Description |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Tests safety and dosage |
| Phase 2 | Further assesses safety and effectiveness |
| Phase 3 | Confirms safety and effectiveness, compares to existing treatments |
| Phase 4 | Monitors safety and effectiveness after approval |
