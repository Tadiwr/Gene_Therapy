# What are Phases

 The variable phases in the dataset refers to the different phases of clinical trials that a gene therapy drug has completed. There are four phases of clinical trials:

Phase 1: This is the first phase of clinical trials, and it is typically conducted in a small group of healthy volunteers. The purpose of phase 1 trials is to assess the safety of the drug and to determine the dosage that is safe to use.

Phase 2: This phase of clinical trials is typically conducted in a larger group of people with the disease that the drug is intended to treat. The purpose of phase 2 trials is to assess the effectiveness of the drug and to determine any side effects that may occur.

Phase 3: This phase of clinical trials is typically conducted in a large group of people with the disease that the drug is intended to treat. The purpose of phase 3 trials is to confirm the effectiveness of the drug and to compare it to other treatments that are available.

Phase 4: This phase of clinical trials is conducted after the drug has been approved for marketing. The purpose of phase 4 trials is to collect more data on the safety and efficacy of the drug, and to monitor any long-term side effects.
