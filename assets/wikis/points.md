    The points column in the dataset represents the number of points awarded to the clinical trial based on its criteria. The criteria for awarding points are as follows:

- Severity of the disease being treated: The more severe the disease, the more points are awarded.
- Potential for the gene therapy to be effective: The greater the potential for the gene therapy to be effective, the more points are awarded.
- Phase of the clinical trial: The more advanced the phase of the clinical trial, the more points are awarded.

# Ranges
Range description of points from high to low

- Highest points: 37 points. This is awarded to clinical trials that are targeting severe diseases, have the potential to be effective, and are in Phase 3, which is the final phase of clinical trials.
- Mid-range points: 15-36 points. This is awarded to clinical trials that are targeting severe diseases, have the potential to be effective, and are in Phase 1 or 2, which are early-stage trials.
- Lowest points: 6-14 points. This is awarded to clinical trials that are targeting less severe diseases, have the potential to be effective, and are in Phase 1 or 2, which are early-stage trials.

# Example 
For example, a clinical trial for 

    Safety and Efficacy of AAV2-hCHM
    in Subjects With CHM 
    (Choroideremia) Gene Mutations

(row 0 in the dataset) has been awarded 10 points. This is because the disease being treated, choroideremia, is a severe genetic eye disease that can lead to blindness. The gene therapy being studied has the potential to be effective in treating choroideremia, and the clinical trial is in Phase 1/2, which is an early-stage trial.
