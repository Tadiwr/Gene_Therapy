# Drug Id
  The variable drug ID is a unique identifier for a drug. It is used to identify a drug across different databases and datasets. Drug IDs are typically assigned by a government agency or pharmaceutical company.
  The variable drug Id is important to researchers and health proffesionals to identify which drug is giving the most successful trails and they will use the effective drugs

| Drug | Description |
|---|---|
| SPK-7001 | Experimental gene therapy for choroideremia, a rare genetic eye disease that leads to blindness. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for choroideremia into the retina. |
| AMT-061 | Experimental gene therapy for hemophilia B, a genetic blood disorder that prevents the body from making a protein called factor IX. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for factor IX into the liver. |
| BIIB-111 | Experimental gene therapy for choroideremia. It is a two-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for choroideremia into the retina. |
| AMT-090 | Experimental gene therapy for Parkinson's disease. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for the production of GDNF, a protein that helps to protect nerve cells in the brain. |
| VYAADC-01 | Experimental gene therapy for Parkinson's disease. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for the production of AADC, an enzyme that helps to break down dopamine. |
| Luxturna | FDA-approved gene therapy for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a rare genetic eye disease that leads to blindness. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for LCA into the retina. |
| SPK-9001 | Experimental gene therapy for Stargardt disease, a rare genetic eye disease that leads to vision loss. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for Stargardt disease into the retina. |
| A-001 | Experimental gene therapy for retinitis pigmentosa, a group of rare genetic eye diseases that lead to vision loss. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for retinitis pigmentosa into the retina. |
| CERE-120 | Experimental gene therapy for Batten disease, a rare genetic brain disorder that leads to progressive neurological decline. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for Batten disease into the brain. |
| GT-AADC | Experimental gene therapy for Parkinson's disease. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for the production of AADC, an enzyme that helps to break down dopamine. |
| BIIB-112 | Experimental gene therapy for Parkinson's disease. It is a two-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for the production of GDNF, a protein that helps to protect nerve cells in the brain. |
| AAV1-gammasarcoglycan | Experimental gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic muscle disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for gammasarcoglycan, a protein that helps to strengthen muscle cells. |
| A-00X | Experimental gene therapy for Usher syndrome, a group of rare genetic disorders that cause hearing loss and vision loss. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for Usher syndrome into the inner ear and retina. |
| AAV-CFTR | Experimental gene therapy for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and other organs. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for CFTR, a protein that helps to move mucus out of the lungs. |
| rAAV1-CMV- hGAA | Experimental gene therapy for Fabry disease, a rare genetic disease that causes the buildup of a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in the body. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for hGAA, an enzyme that helps to break down GL-3. |
| rAAV2-CB- hRPE65 | Experimental gene therapy for Stargardt disease. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for Stargardt disease into the retina. |
| AAV2CUhCLN2 | Experimental gene therapy for Batten disease. It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for Batten disease into the brain. |
| NLX-P101 | Experimental gene therapy for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). It is a single-dose treatment that delivers a functional copy of the gene responsible for LCA into the retina. |
